          TiffinBox was born out of a simple idea: to serve food that feels like home.
          Our founders, once students and professionals living away from home, realized
          the value of a warm, wholesome meal in a busy day. What started as a small
          kitchen has now grown into a full-fledged tiffin delivery service — trusted
          by hundreds across the city.

          Every meal we serve is made with handpicked ingredients and care — just like
          your mom would make it. Because we know, food isn’t just fuel. It’s comfort,
          it’s culture, it’s love.
